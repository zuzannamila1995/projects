      <h1>Wrox Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        <p>I adapted this recipe from a book called <cite cite="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/0864119917/">Sydney food
          </cite>by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney,
          I have been after the recipe. I have since transformedit into what I really believe are the <em>best</em> scrambled eggs I
          have ever tasted</p>
        <p>This recipe is what I call a <q>very special breakfast</q>; just look at the ingredients to see why. It as to be tasted to 
          be believed.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>The following ingrediants make one serving:</p>
          <ul>

              <li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
              <li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>
              <li></li>

            <li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20
               seconds</li>
